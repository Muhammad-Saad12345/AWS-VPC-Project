ADVANCED VPC PROJECT - PUBLIC + PRIVATE SUBNET + NAT + VPC ENDPOINT

Step 1: Create VPC

* Name: custom-vpc
* IPv4 CIDR block: 172.16.0.0/16

Step 2: Create Subnets
Public Subnet:

* Name: Public-Subnet-A
* CIDR block: 172.16.0.0/24

Private Subnet:

* Name: Private-Subnet-B
* CIDR block: 172.16.1.0/24

Step 3: Create and Attach Internet Gateway

* Name: custom-igw
* Attach it to your VPC

Step 4: Create Route Tables

Public Route Table:

* Name: public-rt
* Route: 0.0.0.0/0 -> Internet Gateway
* Associate with Public Subnet

Private Route Table:

* Name: private-rt
* Associate with Private Subnet
* No route to internet yet

Step 5: Launch EC2 Instances

Public EC2:

* Name: pub-ec2
* Subnet: Public-Subnet-A
* Public IP: Yes
* Allow SSH and ICMP in Security Group

Private EC2:

* Name: prt-ec2
* Subnet: Private-Subnet-B
* Public IP: No
* Allow SSH from Public EC2

Step 6: NAT Gateway Setup

* Create NAT Gateway in Public Subnet
* Attach Elastic IP to it
* Edit private route table
* Add route: 0.0.0.0/0 -> NAT Gateway

Step 7: VPC Endpoint for S3

* Go to VPC -> Endpoints
* Create Endpoint
* Service: com.amazonaws.region.s3
* Type: Gateway
* Select VPC and private route table
* Policy: Full access or specific bucket access

Step 8: Create IAM Role for EC2 to Access S3

* Create role with AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
* Attach role to Private EC2

Step 9: Validate

* SSH from Public EC2 to Private EC2 using PEM file
* Run this command in Private EC2:
  aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name
* You should get the list of objects from S3
